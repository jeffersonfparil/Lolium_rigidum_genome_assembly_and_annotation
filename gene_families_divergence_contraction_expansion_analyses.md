# Across multiple species, cluster gene families, align, estimate divergence times, and identify expanded and contracted gene families

**NOTE:** We need to have the gene annotation on-hand to perform these analyses.

## Cluster gene families with OrthoMCL
```{sh}
wget https://orthomcl.org/common/downloads/software/v2.0/orthomclSoftware-v2.0.9.tar.gz
tar -xvzf orthomclSoftware-v2.0.9.tar.gz
cd orthomclSoftware-v2.0.9/
```

## Align gene families across species with MAFFT
```{sh}
sudo apt install -y mafft
```

## Estimate divergence between species times using MCMCTREE and TimeTree.org fossil record estimates


## Identify expanded and contracted gene families for each species
